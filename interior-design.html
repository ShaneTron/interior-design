      <p class="text"><span class="during">This place looks a lot better. Theres nothing in here but you should have seen this place before. I would rather live in a cardboard box in the rain than this place before we tore it apart</span></p>

      <p class="text"><span class="after">Finally, a place actually worth living. You can actually see the walls and the floor, but I can't be sure that huge rat is gone. We named him Carl, and he is definitely not our problem. I hope Cindy can get rid of it.</span></p>
